## Functionality 
Using just "vanilla" JavaScript (ES6), this app enables users to purvey offered destinations, select one, and to book a trip. This trip will then be posted to the user's "Pending Trips" in the app. Users may also view past booked trips for themselves. There are destinations from all over the world, so take a good look at all of them!
